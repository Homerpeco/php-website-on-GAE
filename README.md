# php website on GAE
# Problems with the app.yaml file

I am hosting my website (php files) in GAE, which has 8 pages. 
The app.yaml file is not routing the other pages of my site.  When I click on any link of my site navigation, an error pops-up: Error: No Found  The requested URL /file.php was not found on this server.
